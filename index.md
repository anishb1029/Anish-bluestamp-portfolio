# 3 Joint Robotic Arm with BSE
The 3 joint robotic arm, despite how simple it is to the eye, was a tough build because of all the challenges that I had to face to end up the the result that I currently have. Broken motors, faulty codes, and unstable bases have led me to the belief that this project was one of the more challenging ones of the level because of the modifications needed to make the arm as healthy as possible.

For your final milestone, explain the outcome of your project. Key details to include are:
- What you've accomplished since your previous milestone
- What your biggest challenges and triumphs were at BSE
- A summary of key topics you learned about
- What you hope to learn in the future after everything you've learned at BSE



# Second Milestone

My second milestone shows that I have completed my assembly and found out some other simple errors, like disorganized cables and how my base was unsturdy (the screw was too loose). I planned to make a lazy susan type foundation for my robotic arm, but the parts hadn't arrived yet, so I was stuck with the finished assembly and sample code. My goal for the third milestone is to find out what I can do to the code to better my project, and to add the mods needed to strengthen the base.

# First Milestone

My first milestone was building almost all of the 3 joint robotic arm and uploading the sample code to the Arduino UNO. Although this was a task I could have completed within the first 3 days, a broken servo motor set me back quite a bit. On top of that, my robotic arm was experiencing an extremely unsturdy base made me think about modifications to strengthen that part of the project. Overall, I thought of this as an awesome beginning to my robotic arm.

# Schematics 
Here's where you'll put images of your schematics. [Tinkercad](https://www.tinkercad.com/blog/official-guide-to-tinkercad-circuits) and [Fritzing](https://fritzing.org/learning/) are both great resoruces to create professional schematic diagrams, though BSE recommends Tinkercad becuase it can be done easily and for free in the browser. 

# Code
Here's where you'll put your code. The syntax below places it into a block of code. Follow the guide [here]([url](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/)) to learn how to customize it to your project needs. 

```c++
void setup() {
  // put your setup code here, to run once:
  Serial.begin(9600);
  Serial.println("Hello World!");
}

void loop() {
  // put your main code here, to run repeatedly:

}
```

# Other Resources/Examples
One of the best parts about Github is that you can view how other people set up their own work. Here are some past BSE portfolios that are awesome examples. You can view how they set up their portfolio, and you can view their index.md files to understand how they implemented different portfolio components.
- [Example 1](https://trashytuber.github.io/YimingJiaBlueStamp/)
- [Example 2](https://sviatil0.github.io/Sviatoslav_BSE/)
- [Example 3](https://arneshkumar.github.io/arneshbluestamp/)
